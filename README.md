# NeoForgeAP

NeoForge port/rewrite
of [the Minecraft Forge Archipelago mod by KonoTyran](https://github.com/KonoTyran/Minecraft_AP_Randomizer/)
licensed under MIT.

Lots of internal overhauls have been made to reduce possibility for crashes.
Several additional issues known by the community, especially the async community, have been resolved as well.

Not intended to compete with the mod or
the [ongoing rewrite](https://github.com/KonoTyran/archipelago-randomizer-fabric),
merely made for personal use.
Some fixes may be submitted upstream though I was never really able to get the original mod to compile
to be able to work on it.
